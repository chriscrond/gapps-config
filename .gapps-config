# OPENGAPPS - GAPPS-CONFIG
############################

ADVANCED FEATURES AND OPTIONS
###############################

# All variants of the Open GApps installer (except Aroma*) will look for and take extra configuation options from a gapps-config file. This file is completely optional; without it, the installers will function exactly as described in the Package Comparison chart [01]. The gapps-config file allows for these kinds of customizations and more:

#   - You can limit which GApps are installed.
#   (example use case: "I don't want Google Play Books to be installed.")
#   - You can limit which stock apps the installer removes.
#   (example use case: "I want to install Google Camera but I don't want the stock camera removed.")
#   - You can make the installer remove stock apps apps of your choice.
#   (example use case: "I want to remove the stock Spare Parts app.")

# * The Aroma Package [02] includes the Super package and a GUI that provides roughly the same set of customizations as the gapps-config file. It can load and save configurations, but it uses its own format and will not read the gapps-config file.


# GAPPS-CONFIG FILE LOCATION
##############################

# You can place the gapps-config file in /sdcard/Open-GApps/gapps-config.txt, or in 11 other locations as follows. The gapps-config file must be named one of the following:
#   - .gapps-config (takes precedence)
#   - gapps-config.txt

# The gapps-config file must be placed in one of the following folders:
#   - the folder containing the Open GApps installer (takes precedence)
#   - /sdcard/Open-GApps
#   - /persist

# You can have a device-specific gapps-config file. You will need your device name, which you can find in open_apps_log.txt or in the name of your ROM download. The gapps-config file must be named one of the following:
#   - .gapps-config-DEVICENAME
#   - gapps-config-DEVICENAME.txt

# Device-specific config files will take precedence over the non-device-specific ones.


# WRITING AND TESTING THE GAPPS-CONFIG FILE
#############################################

# The gapps-config file consists of one keyword per line. The available keywords are categorized in the sections below. If you want to use different settings per device, you can create a text file named .gapps-config-devicename or gapps-config-devicename.txt replacing devicename with your device's codename (which is also shown in open_gapps_log.txt) and put it in the same locations described above. (You can usually find it in the name of your ROM download). If you don't provide one, the normal gapps-config file will be used.


# COMMENTS AND WHITESPACE
###########################

# You can add notes or comments to your gapps-config using a #. Anything following a # will be ignored until the end of that line. For example, # Exclude Search would be completely ignored, while Search # Exclude Search would process the first Search keyword (since it appeared BEFORE the #). Case, order, spaces, and empty lines are ignored in the gapps-config file.


# TESTING
###########

# To perform a test installation that will only simulate an install, add the keyword Test to your gapps-config. The installer will perform all system space calculations and generate a detailed open_apps_log.txt file (in the same folder as your gapps-config), but WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES to your device. This should be helpful for trying to find just the right combination of apps that will work with your particular device.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#Test


# DEBUG LOGS
##############

# By default, the installer will generate Debug Logs that can help the devs troubleshoot any problems you might experience with the install. The logs are compressed and stored in a file named open_gapps_debug_logs.tar.gz in the same folder as the open_apps_log.txt file. This file can be easily attached to any bugreport on GitHub or post on XDA, making it easy for you to provide the devs important information to help troubleshoot any issues you're having. You may disable this feature by adding the keyword NoDebug to your gapps-config.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#NoDebug


# CONFIGURING YOUR INSTALLATION
#################################

# DOWNSIZING
##############

# You can transform any GApps package into one of its "little brothers" by adding one of the following keywords to your gapps-config. This will transform ALL INSTALLER BEHAVIOR (including default removals AND applications available for install) -- effectively turning it into the smaller GApps package. Valid keyword options are:

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
# StockGApps                # [Super+]
# FullGApps                 # [Stock+]
# MiniGApps                 # [Full+]
# MicroGApps                # [Mini+]
# NanoGApps                 # [Micro+]
# PicoGApps                 # [Nano+]


# INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE GAPPS
############################

# You can choose either the apps you WANT installed or the apps you DON'T WANT installed.

#   - "Include" install: To select ONLY the apps you WANT installed, add the keyword Include to your gapps-config file. The installer will now install ONLY THOSE APPS you have listed in your gapps-config.
#   - "Exclude" install: To select ONLY the apps you DON'T want installed, no keyword is necessary, because the default behavior is an Exclude install.

# To use this feature, add the the keyword for each app you want to Include/Exclude inside your gapps-config file. The following is a sample "Include" gapps-config that contains all available app keywords -- using this gapps-config without modifications will install all apps the installer has available. You start with this file and comment out the apps you do not want installed.

# PREVENT AUTOMATIC STOCK REMOVALS
####################################

# When installing a Google app that can replace a stock app, the stock app is automatically removed. For example, if you are installing Hangouts or Messenger, then the Stock SMS app will automatically be removed.

# To prevent the automatic removal of the stock apps when using the Open GApps Super/Stock package, type the keyword option preceded by a '+' as shown below:

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
# +Browser                  # Don't remove Stock Browser, even if Google Chrome is being installed
# +CalendarStock            # Don't remove Stock Calendar, even if Google Calendar is being installed

# +PicoTTS                  # Don't remove PicoTTS, even if GoogleTTS is being installed



# REMOVE STOCK APPS
#####################

# You can specify built-in (stock) apps you want removed. Stock removals function the same regardless of whether you're doing an "Include" or "Exclude" install. Here are the vendors we support. Since different vendors use different names for their stock apps, some apps might remain unremoved if you are using another vendor.

#   - AOSP
#   - BLU
#   - CyanogenMod
#   - Flux
#   - FlymeOS (BrowserIntl, Browser, CustomizeCenter, EasyLauncher, FileManager, FlymeLauncherIntl, FlymeLauncher, MzMPay, MzPay, MzInput, MzSetupWizard, MzUpdate, SystemUpdate, SystemUpdateAssistant, Weather)
#   - Lenovo (packageinstaller)
#   - Miui
#   - MoKee (Nox launcher, YuBrowser)
#   - Motorola
#   - Omni (Apollo, Omni Deskclock2, OmniSwitch)
#   - Paranoid Android

# To use this feature, add the the keyword for each stock app you want removed, inside your gapps-config file. The following is a sample gapps-config that contains all available stock removal keywords -- using this gapps-config without modifications won't remove anything (that is not automatically removed, see below). You can start with this file and uncomment the apps you want removed:

########## EXAMPLE INCLUDE INSTALL FINISH ###########


# In addition to the Stock Removals above, you can remove ANY system app on your device or ROM, with the EXCEPTION of (core) apps that are part of Open GApps itself. To use this feature, enclose the name of the apk in parentheses inside your gapps-config file. For example, to remove the Spare Parts app found in many ROMs, simply add (SpareParts) to your gapps-config. When using this feature, keep the following in mind:

# Adding the .apk extension is not required (but will work).
# Works for all apps in any system/app or system/priv-app subfolder.
# Removes the entire contents of the folder containing the apk (including subfolders).
# Removal is also added to the addon.d backup script so the removals will also be applied if you update your ROM.
# Gives you the ability to do some really bad things to your device, so DO A BACKUP before trying.

# WARNING: Because this feature gives you the ability to remove files that may be important to the proper function of your device, it is only recommended for very experienced users who know what they are doing.


# ENABLE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
###########################

Open GApps can add ro.opa.eligible_device=true to the build.prop file, to enable Google Assistant. By default this feature is not enabled, but it can be activated by adding the GoogleAssistant keyword. If there is any line with ro.opa.eligible_device already in the build.prop it will NOT be overwritten.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#GoogleAssistant


# FORCE DPI SETTING
#####################

# Open GApps normally selects the correct DPI-optimized app that suits your device [12], based on the information that is supplied by recovery and otherwise found in default.prop or build.prop. Sometimes one might want to override this DPI setting, e.g. for testing, in those situations the keyword forcedpiXXX can be used, where XXX is replaced with one of the valid default DPIs including: 120, 160, 213, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320, 340, 360, 400, 420, 480, 560, 640 or nodpi

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):

# forcedpi360
# forcedpi400
# forcedpi420
# forcedpi480
# forcedpi560
# forcedpi640
# forcedpinodpi


# FORCE NEW CAMERA
####################

# Open GApps normally detects if the device is deemed compatible with the New Camera API based on fields specified in build.prop and a whitelist. If not deemed compatible, the newest Google Camera (version 3 and higher) will not be installed but the older version 2 instead (googlecameralegacy). To override this detection the forcenewcamera keyword can be used. Note: Google Camera version 3 does not work correctly on most non-Nexus devices.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#forcenewcamera


# SKIP GOOGLE'S SWYPE LIBRARY SETTING
#######################################

# The Stock keyboard does normally not support gesture typing. If Google Keyboard is not being installed, Open GApps installs by default Google's swype gesture libraries to the Stock keyboard. The libraries are installed in addition to the AOSP libraries. In some cases adding these libraries is unwanted behavior (there are few reports that recent these can conflict with certain ROMs). In those situations use the skipswypelibs keyword to skip the installation of these libraries (or remove them if previously installed).

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#skipswypelibs


# SUBSTITUTE AOSP LIBRARY WITH GOOGLE'S SWYPE LIBRARY SETTING
###############################################################

# The Stock keyboard does normally not support gesture typing. If Google Keyboard is not being installed, Open GApps installs by default Google's swype gesture libraries to the Stock keyboard. The libraries are installed in addition to the AOSP libraries. In some cases these gesture libraries only work if they are installed as a replacement of the AOSP libraries (there are few reports that this is necessary with certain ROMs). In those situations use the substituteswypelibs keyword to replace the Stock libraries. (If you re-run the installation without the keyword, the AOSP libraries are restored to their original configuration).

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#substituteswypelibs


# SKIP UPDATING VENDOR LIBRARIES
##################################

# Open GApps by default updates certain libraries that are depended on by certain GApps (especially Face Unlock) that are stored in /system/vendor (or a /vendor partition via a symlink). To prevent GApps from touching (removing, adding or replacing) these vendor files use the skipvendorlibs keyword.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#skipvendorlibs


# SKIP SMART PRE-ODEXING OF APKS
##################################

# On Marshmallow some ROMs are set to be extremely strict when verifying the APK. This can lead to de-odexed APKs to fail verification; because the included classes.dex is not present in the APK's MANIFEST. To avoid this potential issue, Open GApps by default pre-ODEXes these APKs on 6.0+. As positive side-effect this setting also improves the performance of these applications. A downside is that it occupies more disk-space on /system, because a copy of the classes.dex has to be kept for regenerating the ODEX when updating the ROM. To disable this feature use the keyword NoPreODEX. THE PRE-ODEX FEATURE IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED BY DEFAULT; SEE BELOW HOW TO ENABLE

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#NoPreODEX


# ENABLE SMART PRE-ODEXING OF APKS
####################################

# To enable Pre-ODEXing on ROMs the PreODEX can be used.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#PreODEX


# FORCE CLEAN INSTALL SETTING
###############################

# Open GApps normally detects if it's a clean install or an upgrade. This affects how installation of Google Camera is treated, it won't install those unless this is a clean install to avoid problems during upgrades. To ignore the detection and enforce clean install use forceclean keyword. Note: this setting is untested widely and may cause problems.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#forceclean


# PROTECTION FROM STUPIDITY
#############################

# To prevent you from accidentally leaving yourself with no keyboard, Launcher, or MMS app when you start your device, the installer WILL NOT ALLOW you to remove the Stock Keyboard, Launcher, or MMS app if you are not also installing a Google version of these apps. You can, however, override this protection by adding the keyword Override to your gapps-config. Be very careful when using this option and make certain you have a replacement app already installed on your device before using this option. This keyword can also be used to override the automatic selection of WebViewStub over WebViewGoogle if Chrome is being installed.

## Un-comment to activate the selection(s):
#Override
