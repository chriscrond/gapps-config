Config Template for Open GApps - The Open Google Apps Project

This repository is to host my work on an easy to use .gapps-config template for the Open GApps Project.

The config template aims to serve two purposes, both as a documentation resource for the advanced features and options of which they govern, and of course to govern these advanced features and options.
The format is intended to be easy to digest and easy to use.

The layout, descriptions, and the features and options themselves track the documentation provided in the 'Advanced Features and Options' page of the Open Gapps wiki. [1]
